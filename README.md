# CA_CPU
This Is For CA Project
We have made the design for CPU for simpleRisc Instruction set.

Additional programs.
Here Simplerisctohex program converts simple risc instructions to hex string.

Do Not Put Commas During The Instructions
It takes The Instructions From an input stream.

While making a loop you need to put the offset instead of label and for call statements you are required to input the line number or address of next instruction.

This Was Made Using Logisim Evolution v3.8.0
